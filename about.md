I'm Scott Determan, Seelabs' founder and chief bottle washer. I've been building
solutions for computer vision problems for over twenty years. Seelabs' first project
is an environment for computer vision based on spreadsheets. Once it's released,
you are welcome to use it for free. You can also hire us to build solutions for
you.
