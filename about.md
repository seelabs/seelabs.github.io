At Seelabs we love solving computer vision problems. Our first project is Vision Spreadsheet. Once it's released, you are welcome to use it for free. You can also hire us to build solutions for you.

## Seelabs is all about:

* Identifying objects in images
* Tracking moving objcts in a video
* Building fast, maintainable code
* Solving _your_ computer vision problems
