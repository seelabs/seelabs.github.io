Seelab teaches computers to tell us interesting things about images and videos. You can hire us to build solutions for you or (if you're a computer vision expert yourself) you are welcome to use our free tools to solve your own problems. 

## Seelabs is all about:

* Identifying objects in images
* Tracking moving objcts in a video
* Building fast, maintainable code
* Solving _your_ computer vision problems
