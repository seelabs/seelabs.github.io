Reaction diffusion systems are partial differential equations that describe how the concentration of chemicals change over time. They also make very interesting patterns that depend on their parameters in interesting ways. As usual, wikipedia has a nice description: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system>.

I saw a very nice talk on reaction-diffusion systems at a python conference. Soon after the python conference, these systems were mentioned in an online MOOC I was watching. Just for fun, I used Vision Spreadsheet to implement the Gray Scott model of reaction diffusion equations (see: <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/>). If you run the video above you can see how the parameters change the patterns.
